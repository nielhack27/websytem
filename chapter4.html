 	<p id="algebraic">Algebraic equation</p>
 	<p><b>Algebraic equation</b>, statement of the quality of two expressions formulated by applying to a set of variables the algebraic operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to a power, and extraction of a root. Examples are <i>x</i><sup>3</sup> + 1 and (<i>y</i><sup>4</sup><i>x</i><sup>2</sup> + 2<i>xy - y</i>)/(<i>x -</i> 1) = 12. An imprtant special case of such equations is that of polynomial equations, expressions of the form <i>axn + bxn</i><sup>-1</sup> + ... + <i>gx</i> + <i>h</i> = <i>k</i>. They have as many solutions as their degree (<i>n</i>), and the search for their solutions stimulated much of the development of classical and modern algebra. Equations like <i>x</i> sin(<i>x</i>) = <i>c</i> that involve nonalgebraic operations, such as logarithms or trigonometric functions, are said to be transcendental.</p>

 	<p id="chemical">Chemical compound</p>
 	<p>A chemical compound is a chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemically bonded chemical elements, with a fixed ratio determining the composition</p>
 	<p>The ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula</p>
 	<p>For example, water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom</p>
 	<p>The atoms within a compound can be held together by a variety of interactions, ranging from covalent bonds to electtrostatic forces in ionic bonds</p>
 	<p>A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bond (as in H2) and ionic bonds.</p>
 	<p>For example H<sub>2</sub>O is held together by polar covalent bonds</p>
 	<p>Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound.</p>
